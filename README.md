AsyncIterator
=============

Generic JavaScript class for creating an iterator that yields the UI thread via setImmediate.

The sample project is put in a simple Windows Store app, but the code can be dropped into any other project. The js/asynciterator.js file contains the class implementation, js/default.js contains some test code.
